#Simple Chat application using Ajax

This project is a remake from the assignment from week 5 @ The Iron Yard

*for this repository to work you need to have several things installed before the magic happens.*

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to containing folder and using terminal ensure that you are on master branch.
3. Copy the following into terminal.  
  - npm install && bower install (this will install any nessisary files that the project is missing since the .gitignore is in effect.)
4. You may have to also install browserify depending on your version of installed npm.
  - Copy and paste the text below if the npm and bower do not work automatically.
  - npm install stream-browserify
5. Type in Gulp into terminal and a browser page should automatically pop up and the application should be running.

****As a caviate, until this project is fully functional master assume that master is broken until noted on this readme otherwise.****
